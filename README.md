🚀 Node.js API POC
This repository is a Proof of Concept (POC) showcasing a simple and scalable Node.js API built using Express.js and MongoDB. It demonstrates the core functionality of RESTful APIs, including:

🔐 User Registration & Login (Authentication)

📝 CRUD Operations with MongoDB

🧪 API Testing using Postman

⚙️ Modular project structure for scalability

🛠 Tech Stack
Node.js

Express.js

MongoDB (with Mongoose)

Postman (for testing)

bcrypt (for password hashing)

JSON Web Tokens (JWT for authentication)

📌 Purpose
This POC is designed for learning and demonstration purposes. It's ideal for developers who want to understand the basics of building secure and modular APIs using Node.js and Express.js.

Node.js API POC using Express and MongoDB. Features auth (register/login), JWT, and CRUD. 
Steps: 
1️⃣ Clone repo 
2️⃣ Install deps 
3️⃣ Set Mongo URI 
4️⃣ Run server 
5️⃣ Test with Postman. 

Clean structure for learning and real-world use.
